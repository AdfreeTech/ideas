# adfree.tech
The goal of adfree.tech is to offer a growing number of simple web services. As the name suggests, this is to be done without advertising, so that the tools remain simple and clear and offer the greatest possible benefit. Should there be a growing interest, the operation must of course be guaranteed, more about this further down below.

For each of these tools, there will be a separate repository where the community will be invited to participate in improving the functionality. Approved PRs will then be automatically made available on the adfree.tech host. 

## Idea collection
Current implementation ideas (please contribute your ideas via pull request):

### JSON to CSV Converter
Tool to automatically convert a JSON array to a CSV file, writing each JSON property to its own column.

### Date Calculator
Tool to calculate dates in various ways, for example:
- Linux timestamp converter
- Add/subtract X seconds/minutes/hours/... to date Y
- Calculate seconds/minutes/hours... since date Y
- ...

### Number base converter (bin, dec, hex, ..) 
Converts hex to dec, hex to bin and dec to hex and vice versa. Several options for visualization.

### Loan interest calculator
Simple interest calculator

## Service Operation
The goal of the project is to offer the services free of charge and without advertising for an unlimited period of time. To achieve this, if there is sufficient interest from users, the project will reach the point where it will have to rely on donations - similar to the Wikipedia project - or other monetization options. From the current point of view, a "contributor account", which gets faster access to the services in case of increased demand, is the most likely option. A contributor in this sense would be a user who has either contributed something to the development or financially in the form of a donation. We will see how exactly this topic develops, and keep everyone that is interested updated.
